This project aims to explore the potential correlation between adult obesity rates and the median income across different states in the United States.

## Data Collection and Preparation

- Curated and cleaned data from various reputable sources, including the CDC, Census, and the Department of Labor.
- Conducted meticulous data formatting and structuring to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset.

## Model Development

- Constructed a robust multivariate linear regression model using the collected data.

## Findings

Our regression analysis yielded compelling results, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. The outcome suggests a notable relationship between the adult obesity rate and the median income within the United States.

The alternative hypothesis was supported, indicating a statistically significant correlation between these variables.

## Conclusion

The evidence from our regression model infers a meaningful association between adult obesity rates and median income across the states in the US.

This project showcases the exploration and identification of a potential linear relationship between adult obesity rates and median income, providing valuable insights into social and health demographics across different states in the United States.
